Project Description: Garbage Detection Using YOLOv8 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) The project aims to develop an automated system for detecting and classifying garbage in images or videos. This is achieved using deep learning models, including YOLOv8 for object detection and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
